## Planning, Design and Project Tracking

## Trello Board

firstly i began making a trello board so i knew which was the route i was going to go down from deciding what to create first and what to move on to next, and see my overall progress here is a link to the trello board. ![TrelloBoard](![trello board1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101265381/162193724-7fdce9b5-5484-4bee-8383-9cef30422263.png)


## ERD

I made a basic relationship diagram around with the idea of the expected entities, the diagram might change further into the project but this was my initial design.

## Risk Assessment

My risk assessment, though basic, attempted to percieve possible threats to the project. The entries with proposed Control Measures as opposed to implemented were considered and noted later on towards the end of the project.
